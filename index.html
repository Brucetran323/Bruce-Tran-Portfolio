                <strong><small>Where do I see myself in 5 years?</small></strong>
                <p>When I ask myself where I will be in 5 years, I didn't realize I would be walking into my 30's! I
                    would like to see myself in a management role over a software engineering team.
                    I found my passion for management and customer relations through the foundation Quiktrip has given
                    me, and transition it into the tech field.</p>
                <p>I am currently enrolled in Coding Temple's coding boot camp and was placed in the Clutch-112 cohort.
                    I have taken a small intro to python course on Udemy, and my fascination for python lead me to
                    Coding Temple to possibly break into the tech field. </p>
                <strong><small>Where do I see myself in 10 years?</small></strong>
                <p>My parents are first-generation Vietnamese immigrants, I am very proud to say they are business
                    owners. Their hard work and persistence will be driving factors for my future.
                    Breaking into the tech field will open up many possibilities for entrepreneurship. </p>

                <p>Strength training is a big part of my life, I follow the strong body, strong mind principle. Year to
                    date I've increased max weights by 100 pounds on average. Outside of the gym, I enjoy sports bikes,
                    I first started riding motorcycles at 18. My first bike was a Kawasaki Nina 250r, that bike taught
                    me all the fundamentals like counter steering, lean angle, and road safety. I eventually powered up
                    to a Honda CBR600RR, then finally a Yamaha MT-10! My other few hobbies are building computers and
                    anime! </p>

                        I aspire to be a software engineer and have always had a fascination with tech.
                        From a young age, I was an avid gamer and eventually grew into building gaming computers. My
                        computer-building skill lead me into the rabbit hole of software. The rest will be history!</p>
